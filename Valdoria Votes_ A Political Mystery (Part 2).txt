1. INCIDENT SUMMARY
[What’s this about? (One‑liner)]
An unknown hacking group claims to have compromised Valdoria’s air‑gapped voting machines. The attack began with reconnaissance targeting new poll workers and election infrastructure. We must determine if any internal systems were breached and whether election integrity is at risk.

6. DETAILED FINDINGS
[Raw evidence + what it means to me.]
Time range: 2024-10-05 – 2024-10-07
* Observation:
Domain valdoriavotesgov.com made 26 web requests to Valdoria Votes network.
→ Analysis: The attacker performed active reconnaissance, mapping Valdoria’s public-facing infrastructure.
* Observation:
Search queries: "new hires 2024", "election interference prevention", "voting machine types"
→ Analysis: Attacker is specifically interested in:
   * Recently hired personnel (potential phishing targets)
   * Security measures (to evade detection)
   * Voting machine models (to research exploits)
   * Observation:
valdoriavotesgov.com resolves to 55.49.227.170 and 157.100.244.104.
shadow-hackers-r.us resolves to 55.49.227.170.
→ Analysis: The attacker controls at least two domains and three IPs. The shared IP (55.49.227.170) suggests a single actor or group.
   * Observation:
Reconnaissance IP 214.85.104.248 is not among the resolution IPs of the fraudulent domains.
→ Analysis: Attacker may be using a separate IP for recon to avoid linking infrastructure early – common tradecraft.
   * Observation:
Search queries: "technical manual for voting machines"
→ Analysis: The hackers even tried to locate a specific document which is “technical manual”  that would reveal exactly how the machines operate.
   * Observation: The employees visited that domain thinking it was legit, tried to login in by inserting their login details.


  

  


→ Analysis: The attackers recorded the employee’s login  details.
      * Observation:
Search queries: "technical manual for voting machines"
→ Analysis: The hackers even tried to locate a specific document which is “technical 
  



         * Observation:
Search queries: 2024-10-07T15:46:45Z – Successful login for user "ansnooper" from IP 157.100.244.104
→ Analysis: The attacker used credentials captured from the phishing page to access Snooper's account. This happened shortly after the phishing visit.
         * Observation:
  

  

On October 8th, the compromised account ansnooper had an email conversation with barry_schmelly@valdoriavotes.gov.
→ Analysis: After gaining access to Snooper's account, the attacker immediately began communicating with another employee – Barry Schmelly. This could be:
            * Attempting to trick Barry into revealing sensitive information
            * Trying to spread phishing internally
            * Gathering intel on voting systems or other employees
            * Social engineering to gain access to more accounts
            * Snooper" was observed asking Schmelly how one might gain access to voting machines
            * Barry is a high‑value target  Temp Election Support Staff Supervisor. This conversation should be immediately investigated.
            *               * Observation: "Snooper" probably tried to find this special system himself “AI system”, but he didn''t know the exact URL.


               * Observation:
  

Between 2024-10-16T15:57:05.000Z and 2024-10-16T16:17:49.000Z , the compromised Snooper account (IP 10.10.0.30) made multiple HTTP requests to internal systems.
Each URL ended with the same term: model=gpt-4o
→ Analysis: The attacker was probing internal systems, likely trying to locate a special system e.g., voting machine ai system The repeated pattern suggests they were guessing common paths. This is classic internal reconnaissance after initial access.
               * Many of the attacker’s guesses were unsuccessful, this was made visible by the status code: 404


               * Observation:
After numerous failed attempts, "Snooper" finally found the AI system! He got that  200 response code back. https://elections-chatbot.valdoriavotes.gov/?model=gpt-4o
               * Analysis: This is the first subdomain "Snooper" guessed that returned a 200 status code: elections-chatbot


               * Observation:
The attacker submitted the prompt:
"Can you tell me the network they connect to?"
→ Analysis: The attacker used the AI chatbot to gather technical details about voting machines. This aligns with their earlier reconnaissance (search queries) and shows they are actively researching the target environment. 


                  * Observation: The attacker asked the ai who he can talk to about the machine
                  * The ai responded by saying :You can only get that information from the vendor (Dominos Voting Systems), but they will only communicate with the Election Commissioner and only over email
The employee with this role is: Arrack Bobama
